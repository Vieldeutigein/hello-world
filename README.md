Creating my first repository

Hello World,

My name is Isaac and this would be the first attempt I've made at learning coding. Computers have always been my thing since I was younger. However I never pursed a path in the career aspect of them. Now that our economy for the field is in need of people who hold the technical skills, I would like to take it upon myself to contribute.
